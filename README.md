# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


 I made a landing page that calls to the openweather.api successfully.
 I had difficulties managing how to insert the lat and long
 I used a geocoding API to receive lat and long, and the process broke down on plugging that received information intot he openweather.api
